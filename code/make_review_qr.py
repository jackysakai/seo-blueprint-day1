"""Make the review QR code.

⛔ This QR points at the site's OWN /review page, NOT the raw Google review
link. /review is the star-rating gate: 4-5 stars go on to Google, 1-3 stars
get routed to the owner instead. A QR that encoded the Google link directly
would let every scan skip the gate and land straight on a public review
form - exactly the failure this whole skill exists to prevent.

Reads the site's base URL out of website/lib/site.config.ts (`url:`) and
appends /review, so there is still only ONE place you ever paste the domain.
Writes two files:

    website/public/review-qr.png   - for print: invoices, counter cards, trucks
    website/public/review-qr.svg   - vector, scales to any size without blurring

Run it:
    Code/.venv/bin/python Code/make_review_qr.py

Or point it at any URL directly, without touching the config:
    Code/.venv/bin/python Code/make_review_qr.py https://www.example.com/review

Error correction is set to H (30% recoverable). That is deliberate - a QR on a
truck door or a greasy invoice gets scratched, wet and partly covered, and H is
the level that still scans when a chunk of it is gone.
