"""Publish due GBP posts from gbp-queue/ to the Make.com webhook.

Runs from GitHub Actions on a Mon/Wed/Fri cron (or by hand: python3
code/publish_due_gbp_posts.py). Each run sends AT MOST ONE due post, so the
cron IS the cadence: a full queue ships 3 posts a week, a thin one ships what
it has. A post is due when today >= its send_after date.

On a 200 from the webhook the file moves to gbp-queue/sent/ with sent_at
stamped. Anything else leaves the file in place and exits non-zero so the
Actions run shows red. The Make scenario must reply 200 only after the post
actually publishes (Webhook Response module) - see /gbp-posts.
